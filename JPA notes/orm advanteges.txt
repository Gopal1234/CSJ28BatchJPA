1.Object relational Impedance mismatch means that object models and realtional models do not work well together

RDBMS represents data in a tabular format, whereas object oriented languages , such as java represent it as an interconnected graph of object

Loading and storing graph of object using tabluar
relational database exposes us several mismatch problems.









2.Storing object-oriented entities in a relational database is often not a simple 
task and requires a great deal of repetitive code along with conversion 
between data types. 

Object-relational mapper, or O/RM, were created to solve this problem.
 An 
O/RM persists entities in and retrieves entities from relational databases 
without the programmer having to write SQL statements and translate entity 
properties to statement parameters and result set columns to entity properties.


ORM solution:

1.it is an API to perform CRUD operations on object of persistence classes

2.It provides a language to specify queties that refer classes and properties of the class.

3. It provides facility to specify mapping with different object graph


So ORM,
shields developers from the messy SQL

it increases the productivity , maintainability and performance
