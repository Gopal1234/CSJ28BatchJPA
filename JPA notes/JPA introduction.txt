What is JPA:

JPA is just an specification from Sun, which is released under JEE 5
specification.

JPA standardized the ORM persistence technology for Java
developers. 

It needs an ORM implementation to work and persist the Java Objects. ORM
frameworks that can be used with JPA are Hibernate, Toplink, Open JPA etc.

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is one approach to ORM. Via JPA the
developer can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases
to Java Objects and vice versa, JPA permits the developer to work directly
with objects rather then with SQL statements. JPA is a specification and
several implementations are available


Advantages of JPA:
1. You don't need to create tables. In some cases, you don't even need to 
create a database. If any of your entity classes changes, the modern JPA 
provider can be configured to adapt the tables.

2. You don't need to write SQL statements, even though sometimes you may 
have to work with JPQL, the Java Persistence Query Language.
