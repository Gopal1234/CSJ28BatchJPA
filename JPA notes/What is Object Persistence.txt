What is Object Persistence?

Persistence means to make application's data to outlive the application process.

In java terms the object to live beyond the scope of the JVM , so that same state is available later.

Example:
class User                   User
                           name    salary
{                           Amit    2000
String name;
int salary
}

(Object world)


The above diagram depicts mapping of object state into database table 
columns. 
To do so, traditionally, we rely on JDBC API, which allows 
developers to save application data into database, however conversion is 
required from object format to database table format which un-necessarily 
increases line of code . 

However, there are lot of challenges and mismatch in data processing in these 
two models. 
In addition, if database changes, then developer need to make 
modification in the configuration which is database specific.
So to shorten the development time, and to save application object directly into 
database, there was need to reinvent the approach of mapping object and 
relational model.
