1.New State :When an entity object is initially created its state is New. In this 
state the object is not yet associated with an Entity Manager and has no 
representation in the database.


2.Managed State : An entity object becomes Managed when it is persisted to 
the database via an EntityManager’s persist method which must be invoked 
within an active transaction. On transaction commit, the owning Entity 
Manager stores the new entity object to the database
.
Entity objects retrieved from the database by an EntityManager are also in the 
Managed state.

If a managed entity object is modified within an active transaction the change 
is detected by the owning EntityManager and the update is propagated to the 
database on transaction commit.




3.Detached State : represents entity objects that have been disconnected from 
the EntityManager. For instance, all the managed objects of an EntityManager 
become detached when the EntityManager is closed.



4.Removed State : A managed entity object can also be retrieved from the 
database and marked for deletion, by using the EntityManager’s remove 
method within an active transaction. The entity object changes its state from 
Managed to Removed, and is physically deleted from the database during 
commit.
